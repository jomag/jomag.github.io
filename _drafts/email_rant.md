So today I got into talking with a younger colleague about how the use of
email has gone downhill the last ten years. I was baffled to see that even
computer literates of today have little knowledge about how email used
to work.

What not to do:

Don't reply with "my comments in red"

 - Color will go away when responded to with plain text mail clients
 - People are colorblind
 - What to do when you have many levels of replies. My comments in dark-red-green-italic-underline?

Don't put reply at top of letter

 - It's easy to see what parts you reply to and the history if comments
 are placed in the original letter blablah...

 Don't use HTML!

  - When will we have mail clients that understand markdown for basic markup?

Don't put attachments in the signature

 - Hard to see what mails have attachments if all have attachments in the signature!

Don't include the entire mail for each reply

 - Prefer to keep just enough context to make it clear what you respond to.


Describe basic layout of plain text messages and reason about how they are readable both
in plain text readers and rich text readers.


Nag about how most mail clients uppmuntrar bad behavior: gmail replies without quoting by
default. Apple mail says it can reply with plain text, but attachments are placed inline
so not sure about that.

Thunderbird is still ok, if you can locate the "write mail in plain text" option for
each account.

Good examples of mail culture can be found in mailing list, for example: gnome, linux, etc.

With this mail culture email is still a very competent communication platform. And since
email is now probably the most important (async) communication platform, the culture must
be preserved!

We don't want to fall back on proprietary solutions. Not even Slack even though it's convenient.
